# Characterization of Oregon's Shelf Groundfishes and Associated Fisheries

This repo is for my M.S. thesis research and its associated manuscripts. There are two sub-projects/chapters.

### Data
The **NMFS survey data** files used are available in the [NMFS_data](data/NMFS_data/) folder
- [species_data_raw](data/NMFS_data/species_data_raw.csv/) contains the original data on species caught in a sample
- [station_data_raw](data/NMFS_data/station_data_raw.csv/) contains the original data for each haul/sample
- This data was retrieved from the [NMFS FRAM Data Warehouse](https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data/map) for 1977-2018

The **Oregon logbook, fish ticket, and vessel data** used are _confidential_ and are therefore unavailable for public use
- This data was obtained with permission from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife
